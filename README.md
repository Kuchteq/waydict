# Waydict - the most bare bones/lowest-level dictionary client out there

A sample project to get me acquainted with the Wayland protocol.

Made specifically to work with [linguee api](https://github.com/imankulov/linguee-api)

Compile with `make`. Pixman, fcft and libcurl required.

## Shortcuts
- ctrl-r to reset the query

## Features/Notes
- Highly inextensible (Missing lots of features)!
- Barely works
